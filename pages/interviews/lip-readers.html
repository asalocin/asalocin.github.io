        <p class="note">
        I first came across the Lip Readers around 2024, when I heard their song <em>High Beams</em> while binging music on Bandcamp. I immediately realized I was listening to a truly special, and the <a href="https://refryrecords.bandcamp.com/album/clean-kitchens-ep" target="_blank"><em>Clean Kitchens EP</em></a> became one of my favorite records that year. I was lucky enough to get in touch with Zack, the guitarist and co-songwriter of the band, and we had a great email exchange about their first EP and the leap to their second record, <em>Relaxation Exercise</em>.

<h2>Part I — Origins & <em>Clean Kitchens</em></h2>
<section class="qa" id="q1">
<p class="qline"><span class="qid">Q1</span>Zack previously mentioned that you were &quot;Guided by Voices/Replacements guys,&quot; which suggests to me a friendship bonded by music... How do you guys meet?</p>
<div class="answer">
<p>we played in a pop punk band together introduced by our mutual friend. I honestly cannot remember the name of the band, but it was around the todd congiliere (tony hawk’s buddy) pop punk scene which i can barely remember any bands from… garrit will know better. But ya we met played shows around california etc and then not long later garritt heard my old band new faultlines, didn’t know it was me, found out, then we started hanging more. Garritt showed me some songs/riffs he was working on and i was blown away.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="qa" id="q2">
<p class="qline"><span class="qid">Q2</span>I&#x27;d like to start our conversation by discussing your first EP, Clean Kitchens. Could you tell me how that project and band came together?</p>
<div class="answer">
<p>we’d played a fair amount of shows, none were memorable, i think we both felt worse after we played because we just couldn’t pull a sound together on stage. Didn’t have enough time to practice, didnt have people who were interested in more than just filling in so at some point we decided no more live shows, just recordings, beatles post rubber soul kinda thing. The bay area music scene was dying pretty badly around then, the new generation coming in and making everything post punk &amp; twee garbage songwriting blandness and we just didn’t fit in. my personal curse i think.</p>
<p>Max had moved back temporarily from NYC and wanted to hang and do something so we recorded in my old basement on tulip ave in oakland and i destroyed my old tascam mkii making it- it literally died while mixing the very last song, the instrumental one, you can hear different instruments fading in and out… got very lucky. Kind of fated in my opinion.</p>

</section>
<section class="qa" id="q3">
<p class="qline"><span class="qid">Q3</span>Were those songs written beforehand or was it a collaborative process?</p>
<div class="answer">
<p>very collaborative in a unique way. We’d play them, we’d figure out a line or two of lyrics, we’d try different parts, a bridge or whatever, and others appeared fully formed, i think garritt had been working on them for years, only one song was mine. So then i would go back, hammer out a demo arranging drums bass whatever else, we’d discuss, and it just kept going. But only one or two songs were complete when we started, mine was like that and i think the first song on it was too. It probably took half a year at most. It didnt comer out for another yearor two… my memory is hazy. Damn you weed!</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="qa" id="q3-2">
<p class="qline"><span class="qid">Q3.2</span>Either alone or together, how’s the songwriting process? Do you pick up chords/harmony first, doodle around the guitar, or maybe melody comes first? How is the process?</p>
<div class="answer">
<p>it varies. Garritt tends to put together a verse chorus and a few keeper lyrics that push me on into a narrative or voice. I will add bass which makes a big difference as i’m of the mccartney school of doing more than just playing the root chords. we ‘ve tried to sit down together and write stuff from scratch but that’s a very rare thing, dont think we’ve ever succeeded with that, so usually it’s me taking garritts sketches and fleshing them out, or evolving parts/chords etc. very back and forth.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="qa" id="q4">
<p class="qline"><span class="qid">Q4</span>The record&#x27;s melodic sensibility is undeniable—who&#x27;s most responsible for it? (I know you answered this before, but is for the record only)</p>
<div class="answer">
<p>definitely both of us, but i am definitely the singer and add in more on that front, but it never works unless garritts foundation is strong and motivating. He pulls them out of the air. We don’t flesh out everything just the ones that hit that sweet spot, like you said earlier, the GBV/Replacements. Another northern california songwriter acquaintance dubbed us Guided by Byrds which i quite liked since they mean a lot to me and me and gene clark share a birthday.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="qa" id="q5">
<p class="qline"><span class="qid">Q5</span>The production on the record is impeccable... The format is really traditional if you think of GVB for example, yet it has a lot of personality; I feel like I am in a kitchen when I listen to it. What was your equipment at the time? it sounds to me like a cassette portastudio release to my ears... I&#x27;d love to hear what you guys used to record this one! (Feel free to get nerdy about equipment!)</p>
<div class="answer">
<p>yup. Tascam MKii portastudio 8 track. Can’t remember what pre amp i was using but i think it was a ‘warm audio’ pre amp, sometimes running it from a macbook into the portastudio for some reason and i had at the time a VERY early magnatone amp which was basically two pieces of wood a speaker and electrical and the fan for the phase. The thing nearly killed me because it was ungrounded and i’d be sitting in front of the 8track trying to do a solo or something, i think there was like a minute and a half solo on one song and i’d be screwing it up and have to rewind the tape and forget i was touching the guitar strings. It literally knocked me off a stool once. I’m not really a gear head, i’m pretty bad at recording in general which is probably one of the reasons nothing i’ve done has ever received any popularity etc but clean kitchens just fell together perfectly. I think that was actually our original band name come to think of it. We did this in i think 2018 so its all a bit hazy…</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="qa" id="q6">
<p class="qline"><span class="qid">Q6</span>Since it sounds to me like a DIY effort, I wonder: How does the collaboration on the recording process function? How the skeleton of each song was made, did you record drums and bass together in real time and then lay down the rest of the tracks, or maybe someone recorded the skeleton of the song all alone first…tell me about it.</p>
<div class="answer">
<p>i think what we did was record a base track with the 3 of us playing live (this was obviously after me and garrit had demo’d it enough to know what we wanted, garritt usually sending me voice memos from his phone when he was writing stuff and id say yay or nay) use it as a foundation, and then phase that track out over time. For the demo part i would make garritt use a click track fro the acoustic rhythm and then i’d do everything else. I am a big believer in a click track which neither of the other guys were so that was maybe the only tension during the whole process, fighting w them about the use of a click track. Which i don’t think we ended up using…So then i’d sit in my basement and build it up w different instruments/amps/pedals, theyd come back hear what i did and say yay or nay, max would do the drums i’d demo’d and garritt kind of stuck to rhythm guitar except on a few places, high beams for instance. I obviously did all the lyrics last so i could bounce down the music and get a bunch of extra tracks for harmonies. Like you said, very traditional, very basic- at the time i wasnt really a fan of production. I’ve since changed a lot in that way. But at the time, all through the time i was doing garage band shit, 2006-2016 or 17 something like that, there was just so much stuff that was like the black keys or the 80s revival stuff, that was just such poor songwriting. I still don’t know many current people whose songwriting i admire so i tended to focus on that and getting whatever i needed from the production to get that intangible, the shivers, whatever you call it when a song knocks you over. I tended to get the feel and then just stop. Its easy to go forever trying to reach the promised land which i’ve also done, but not on this record!</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="qa" id="q7">
<p class="qline"><span class="qid">Q7</span>Who is the person featured on the cover? Also, does the title &quot;Clean Kitchens&quot; carry a specific significance—is it perhaps a reference to Cleaners from Venus, or something more literal?</p>
<div class="answer">
<p>it’s the cover of a richard brautigan book who was a half beatnick half hippy author who lived near where i’m from in bolinas and killed himself eventually. Garritt chose it. He’s great with design. Also a talented artist/illustrator. I also paint and draw lol but dont have the eye he’s got.</p>

<section class="part" id="part-2">
<h2>Part II — The leap to <em>Relaxation Exercise</em></h2>
<section class="qa" id="q8">
<p class="qline"><span class="qid">Q8</span>Relaxation Exercise feels like a distinct shift toward a studio effort. &quot;Memory Lane&quot; is a strong counter-example to the &quot;less is more&quot; cliché, utilizing heavy layering of guitars and vocal harmonies that really make the song pop out. How did the workflow for this LP differ from the EP? Recording process, Songwriting, etc…</p>
<div class="answer">
<p>yes. Relaxation exercise has more of my songs on it (just checked, 5 to garritt’s 7). Garritt’s songs took much longer to form or for the lyrics to emerge, mine did too. The clean kitchens stuff i think for the most part he’d written slowly over a decade maybe, so this was a quicker turnaround and the leftovers of songs we couldnt figure out for that EP… We started it before covid, max wasn’t involved he’d moved back to NY. totally different thing. Id gone through a pretty rough spell, a bad break up, a death of close friend, adopting his dog, and generally falling out of love w the world of music, the scene, the bands around me and what they were doing. The beginning of what led me away from the bay area and music in general, this album is almost like my farewell to all of it. I got really into the cocteau twins and the last 2 talk talk lps, decided that lo-fi meant that you werent really committed… to beauty or transcendence or whatever- all of that jazz thats why i got into music in the first place- that you were interested in sounding like something that already happened cuz you weren’t really interested in creating which is painful to do, like i feel about most everything i hear now. Basically just scared, the way so few people actually SING. Got sick of beer music, beer people, bars, etc. basically i started to grow up finally haha. So i wanted to do something that was gonna make people feel things, i didn’t want to be popular or cool or punk or whatever projecting music people do in cosmopolitan areas… there’s just that element missing from music for the most part now, the earnestness authenticity etc. so i felt like i wanted to really stick my neck out. The other thing was that my 8track died and i was sick of replacing it, they were starting to be more expensive so i just sold it for parts and used logic. It just struck me that analog was just not realistic to use for someone like me who can’t fix stuff, doesn’t know enough to make good decisions etc. part of giving up the dream and moving on which i don’t regret at all, i just wish i’d done the recording more cleanly. I used a very great mixer in LA named brian rosemeyer and that brought out the high end- i just wish i’d done a better job getting stuff recorded which is a big risk when you do it all in your kitchen and me being a smoker and very ambitious with harmonies there are times when youtube spend all day just for one line, you get it and take a deep breath and go to bed bnut in the morning realize you were too close to the microphone or whatvere. Live and learn. I recorded it on a macbook w the warm audio pre amp, maybe some other cheap rack effects gear, can’t really remember! I get pretty zoned in when i’m working and can go for 12 hrs at a time sometimes so its hard to find that room in my memory palace! So ya, a lot of back and forth demoing. I think the song sugar city was recorded and ready maybe a year and a half before the final song was done. The thing about using logic after using 8 tracks for years is the tracks! Unlimited! It was really a big step up for me in my opinion from the EP but since we had no interest or time to play live/tour it was never going to be heard by many people despite our fantasies when we finished it and were incredibly excited. Not a single blog or anything wrote about it or had any interest at all. Garritt didn’t participate as much on it- he’d come over and hammer out guitar tracks and i’d do everything from home for the most part. He’d have a few comments but generally since we have such a similar taste he likes what i do and i like what he does. Makes it easier to just not think about it the way a lot fo bands do, fighting over small details or just putting one person in charge of everything or god forbid, have a producer. Using logic certainly removed the analog sound, but the reason it sounds so good for the most part is because of rosemeyer who works w big name producers all the time- he could understand what i wanted very quickly even if it took a minute to explain he’d get there very quickly, i think we only did a day and a half together mixing. I have no illusions about being a professional in such an unprofessional world so i just try to get things to where the spirit is there and i let it go. It’s REALLY hard, but such an important step in songwriting- to be able to let it go. Took me a long time to figure out. Even on relaxation exercise theres a bit in memory lane where i hear it every time and cringe because one single vocal track got lost in the 2nd chorus and to me it destroys the song for me, 99% vs. 100% and to me that’s just not good enough, but it has to be because even if it does destroy the song there isn’t any pressure on me to succeed so who fucking cares. Its still gorgeous even if it could’ve been so much more. But ya… no studio, just a computer a preamp and one good microphone.</p>

</section>
<section class="qa" id="q9">
<p class="qline"><span class="qid">Q9</span>Did you demo’ed these tracks extensively before entering the studio, or did you use the studio as a writing tool?</p>
<div class="answer">
<p>yes. i probably at one point had 30 versions of off and on, finally just cut away the verse lyrics and i’m happy i did. Garritts song invisible spotlight is probably the starkest though, he probably still has some phone recordings of his original demo. I always loved what i heard, not what he recorded but where the song was pointing to and i was not willing to settle so i put A LOT of work into that one. I am still REALLY happy how it completely transformed. But ya again no studio just the kitchen and the computer so i think your intuition is correct, there was a lot of crafting of these songs despite some being less than 2 minutes long. But also some songs just appear fully formed, country hand, call from sk, but you still have to find the spirit so there is feeling, which can be really painful to fight for and find over a year or often more. Theres a sun kil moon song about songwriting that really gets it right, some transcendent art and some filler on every record and a great need to go outside for a walk when it gets to be too much. We try to minimize the filler with clean kitchens. Maybe thats what you’re responding to?</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="qa" id="q10">
<p class="qline"><span class="qid">Q10</span>The album title suggests peace, yet the lyrics are somewhat often wired with anxiety and melancholia. For example, I think of &quot;Country Hand&quot; right now, which talks of a &quot;roamer&quot; who &quot;can&#x27;t break his yoke.&quot; Is the title Relaxation Exercise intended to contrast the songs? How did the title come about?</p>
<div class="answer">
<p>ha. No real grand motive behind the title, we had a number of really good album titles, we’re really good with stuff like that, even the different band names we’ve had for the project like clean kitchens were great to me, but that one was more about contradiction as well as, for me at least, being in a place with real radical leftist AND new agey woowoo, there’s this sense for me that the title implies which is that a lot of ideology, political or religious or spiritual or rational is essentially empty, a giant contradiction, logical fallacy, whatever you want to call it and that language can’t really work without that. I love it, i think it’s such a great title. It separates people easily in the sense that some people think it’s actually referring to a specific thing, a relaxation exercise that one might perform, but to me its just that instantaneous lightbulb moment where you realize there’s a giant contradiction contrast duality thing hiding in plain sight that very few people notice. As for country hand, that one came out of me almost complete. It is quite mournful and sweet and melancholic as a lot of my songwriting tends to be. It’s really about a similar theme that runs through a lot of songs i’ve written that i honestly never really noticed until recently- about leaving, leaving urban areas, leaving culture, a lot of stuff that’s basically dead or dying anyway, and returning to nature, to the country to the animals and trees and where i believe most of us belong anyway. Country hand is that, a lonely guy whose basically found his place in the mediterranean hills etc of california, basically where i live now, and left with a lot of memories of tough luck and heartbreak from the past that aren’t really worth dredging up, but when they appear this guy can tell some real powerful stories or whatever.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="qa" id="q11">
<p class="qline"><span class="qid">Q11</span>Nostalgia appears to be central in the record. Beyond &quot;Memory Lane,&quot; we have &quot;Call from the SK&quot; where the narrator states: &quot;The Sicilian door in 1944 / We found and then we lost / Calculating the cost.&quot; Why was looking backward such a dominant theme for this specific collection of songs?</p>
<div class="answer">
<p>definitely but not consciously. A lot of times when you create things that work you don’t realize the fullness until its done, you see things there that werent intentional but are even more exact and intense than the things you consciously put in. sometimes its to get the rhyming couplet, sometimes a word just fits because of how it sounds to say it- or sing it really. Its always been important to me to leave room for lucky mistakes and for things to not need to make perfect sense, leave room for the spirit which no one can really control. Spontaneity is really what rocknroll was about. Nobody was thinking too hard about it even when they pretended they were. That line in call from sk is specifically about organized crime and the military beginning to work deliberately and closely together during that invasion, i don’t even know if it was in ‘44 or earlier or later but the rhyme sounds great! Memory lane is about the town i grew up in which is unrecognizable now because of Tech etc people moving there from all over the world and to be curt, ruining it. Ruining it really bad. But i was lucky to grow up there so really we’re back to talking about those contradictions hiding in plain sight and how ultimately they are empty- like walking through the town you grew up in, not recognizing much, very few people remaining, all of that, but even though its completely different its still the same and none of any of that truly matters, just whatvere experience you’re having, thats basically where that contradiction leads you. That experience is the important part. The experience of time passing and how that affects you. It shows who you REALLY are. Thats what memory lane is to me. A part of me is just a tourist to my own life.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="qa" id="q12">
<p class="qline"><span class="qid">Q12</span>Which track proved the most difficult/time-consuming to capture in the studio (was it &quot;Memory Lane&quot;?), and which one came together the fastest?</p>
<div class="answer">
<p>good question. Off and on probably. That song i had the highest hopes for which turned out to be probably the weakest song on the record, back to contradictions and duality and spectrums again! But ya, i had a demo where the harmonies were so good my ambition went through the roof. Then they were impossible to recreate, then i pulled it off, then it fell apart. This kind of thing happening over and over and my voice giving out over and over again with the brian wilson shit. Then i’d go listen to the demo i thought was perfect and realize whatever i was hearing was not in the demo! Very frustrating, like trying to seduce a ghost.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="qa" id="q13">
<p class="qline"><span class="qid">Q13</span>Looking back at the finished record, which track is your personal favorite?</p>
<div class="answer">
<p>it can’t be just one, sugar city, sk, memory lane, invisible spotlight, country hand, even flattest tire is really special to me. To me these are classics written by somebody else not me. I love them dearly. I think i might’ve cried a few times when it was all finished. Writing to you has stirred up a lot inside me, this period of my life is over now. I listen to these songs and boom there i am again, but not exactly. Its something else very hard to explain. These songs transformed me in a way, they were my farewell to places and people, not that any of them will ever know. My favorite thing was this project. Being fortunate enough to have the almost psychic relationship with garritt, it was kind of a dream even though there was barely any time spent. No shows as ‘lip readers’ only ‘clean kitchens’ and those were almost humiliating. Each song is kind of its own world on this album where clean kitchens ep songs existed in the same world together for the most part, the guided by byrds world. Hopefully we’ll reconvene when i have my life together again here in grass valley.</p>

<h2>Part III — Coda (life, listening, quick favorites)</h2>
<section class="qa" id="q14">
<p class="qline"><span class="qid">Q14</span>Are there any future projects currently in the pipeline that you can share?</p>
<div class="answer">
<p>nope! I am a rancher and farmer now, barely. But like i said we never ended or broke up, we’re just older, less time, less of everything and since it was always for love anyway, there was really nothing that could break it up just prevent us from doing more. I think garritt probably is still playing a little bit and he was trying a solo thing for a minute as well that sounded pretty great working with a guy whose name i can’t remember but he was the drummer in the Two Gallants.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="qa" id="q15">
<p class="qline"><span class="qid">Q15</span>What are you listening to right now that excites you?</p>
<div class="answer">
<p>i love the new cate lebon record. Her last few have been amazing. I’ve been listening to the first hope sandoval record again for the first time since i had it in high school when it came out. She was the singer in mazzy star. Its called bavarian fruit bread. I didnt think muhc of it when i bought back in 2000 or whatever but now i think its amazing, just as good as any of the early belle and sebastian stuff, same kinda thing from the same period roughly. A lot of what i listen to is instrumental or ambient now since the spotify algorithm excels in that category and sucks for probably every other. There’s a chick called nala sinephro that has some great stuff, theres an instrumental almost western guitar album by ben von wildenhaus i think called II thats pretty cool. The kinloch nelson compilation that came out a few months ago i think is great, i listen to a lot of guitar stuff like that in the fahey basho vein, like six organs of admittance. Woo is a band that i found in the last few years that i love.</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>haha. Where do i start!? I was a practicing astrologer for a few years, bet you didn’t see that coming! I bought a place to start doing regenerative agriculture and ranching so that basically eats me alive now, very hard work, so gardening and dealing with sheep and chickens and crazy guard dogs, learning heavy equipment and some small engineering. I’m a huge fan of british soccer and have been following arsenal for close to 20 years now.</p>

<ul class="rapid">
<li>Favorite food?</li>
<li>Favorite record ever?</li>
<li>Favorite movie?</li>
<li>Favorite book?</li>
</ul>
<div class="answer">
<p>these are tough so i won’t spend too much time! Food? If you ever find yourself north of san francisco go to sol food, puerto rican, best sandwiches ever and the best chile sauce. Favorite record? Let’s do a tie between talk talk laughing stock, gene clark white light or roadmaster, byrds 5th dimension and replacements don’t tell a soul or let it be. Favorite movie? Another tie between to live and die in la and manhunter. Favorite book? Strange this is the hardest one for me. The patrick melrose novels were the last fiction i think that really absorbed me. I’ve read a lot over the years and went to school for literature for a short time so have a deep love of the russians, lermontov who only wrote one book i believe was amazing and tolstoy. Pynchon, delillo, william gaddis, cormac mccarthy, martin amis, stendhal’s scarlet and black was my favorite book for a long time, not sure why now…</p>

<p class="qline"><span class="qid">Bonus</span>Finally, is there any demo of any song, or an unreleased track you can give us as a gift? This is, of course, free to leave unanswered :) I am a sucker for demos, so a demo of “woman involved” or “memory lane” would be superb. ;)</p>
<div class="answer">
<p>There certainly are but it will take me a minute to dig up most because 2 computers with demos for lip readers on them have died and i never unloaded the hard drives, they are in storage somewhere here…but here’s what i’ll do, i’ll put links to the recordings from the first time we played as lip readers/clean kitchens. In a practice space in south SF in 2015, with sk on drums and jack on the other guitar.</p>
